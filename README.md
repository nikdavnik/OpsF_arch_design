Cloud Environment Structure:
AWS Approach:

    Number of AWS Accounts:

        Development Account: For development and testing environments.

        Production Account: Dedicated to production workloads, including staging and production environments.

        Billing Account: For tracking costs and managing billing at an organizational level.

        Account Isolation: Isolation of environments provides better security and management by applying stricter IAM policies between development, staging, and production.

    Why multiple accounts?

        Security: Isolating environments ensures that compromised credentials in development cannot affect production. Additionally, production and staging environments can be more tightly controlled.

        Cost Management: With separate accounts, each environment can have its own billing tags and cost reports.

        Compliance: Sensitive user data requires higher security, and isolating environments helps ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

GCP Approach:

    Projects: GCP uses projects instead of accounts to isolate environments. We would use:

        Development Project: For the development environment.

        Production Project: For production.

        Billing Account: For financial tracking.

Network Design:

    VPC Architecture:

        AWS: Create a dedicated VPC for the application with private subnets for services (backend, database) and public subnets for load balancers and the frontend (React app).

            Public Subnets: Used for the Load Balancer (e.g., AWS ALB) and the frontend React SPA.

            Private Subnets: Used for the backend (Flask API) and PostgreSQL database, ensuring they're isolated from the internet.

        GCP: Use a VPC network with similar architecture: separate subnets for frontend and backend components.

    Security:

        Security Groups (AWS) / Firewall Rules (GCP): Ensure only required ports are open.

            Backend and database should only accept traffic from specific IPs or services (e.g., the frontend or API gateway).

            Use private subnets to isolate sensitive resources like databases.

            VPN or Direct Connect for hybrid cloud scenarios or secure admin access.

    DNS & Load Balancer:

        Use AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) or GCP HTTP(S) Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the backend and frontend services, ensuring high availability and SSL termination.

Compute Platform:

    Managed Kubernetes Service (EKS on AWS / GKE on GCP):

        Kubernetes Cluster: Use EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) on AWS or GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) on GCP for fully managed Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and ease of management.

        Node Groups:

            Use managed node groups in EKS or Autopilot clusters in GKE, ensuring that the platform handles infrastructure scaling and health.

            Instance Types: For low initial load, choose t3.medium for AWS or n1-standard-1 for GCP. For future scaling, consider arm64 or Graviton instances for cost optimization.

            Auto-scaling: Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for scaling the number of pods based on CPU or memory usage, ensuring cost-effective scaling as traffic increases.

    CI/CD Pipeline:

        Use AWS CodePipeline or Google Cloud Build integrated with GitHub to automate deployments for the application.

        Use ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps-based deployments, where the Kubernetes resources (deployment, services) are defined in Git repositories and automatically deployed to the cluster.

    Containerization:

        Dockerize both the backend (Flask) and frontend (React) apps.

        Use AWS ECR or GCP Container Registry to store container images.

        CI/CD for Containerization:

            Backend: On every commit, a Docker image of the Flask API is built and pushed to ECR/GCR.

            Frontend: Similarly, build and push the React SPA Docker image to the container registry.

Database:

    PostgreSQL:

        AWS: Use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL for a managed database solution with automated backups, scaling, and high availability.

            Enable Multi-AZ deployments for high availability and automated backups for disaster recovery.

        GCP: Use Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, a fully managed database service, with similar features as AWS RDS.

    Backup & Disaster Recovery:

        Enable automated backups on both AWS RDS and GCP Cloud SQL.

        Set up manual backups before major changes.

        Consider using Cross-Region Replication for added resilience in case of a regional outage.

    Scaling:

        For scaling, use Read Replicas in AWS RDS or Cloud SQL replicas in GCP for load balancing read traffic, reducing the load on the primary database instance.

Security:

    IAM & RBAC:

        Kubernetes RBAC: Ensure only authorized users can access specific namespaces or perform operations.

        IAM: Use AWS IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) in EKS and Google Cloud IAM for GKE to ensure fine-grained access control.

    Encryption:

        Data in Transit: Use SSL/TLS for encrypting data between the frontend and backend, as well as between the backend and database.

        Data at Rest: Use AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS for encrypting data stored in the database and other sensitive storage.

    Secrets Management:

        Use AWS Secrets Manager or Google Secret Manager to store sensitive data like database credentials and API keys.

        Kubernetes Secrets for storing sensitive environment variables.
